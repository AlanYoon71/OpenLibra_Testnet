# Purpose

This method aims to reduce communication and setup time for the genesis process, enabling efficient pre-upgrade testing for developers.
And it allows regular validators and beginners to easily set up their own local testnet and experience the genesis setup.
Following these steps, you should have a local testnet running on your Ubuntu system via Docker containers.
Additionally, by adding a VFN to the local network, we can enable external validators to participate,
making it possible to set up a large-scale testnet identical to a real-world environment.

## Local Testnet Setup via Docker Container

This document provides step-by-step instructions to set up a local testnet using Docker containers on an Ubuntu system.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have an Ubuntu system (tested on Ubuntu 20.04) and basic familiarity with the terminal.

## Step 1: Install Docker

Follow these steps to install Docker if it is not already installed on your system:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce -y
sudo docker run hello-world
```
The `hello-world` message confirms that Docker is installed correctly.

## Step 2: Run Docker Containers

Run the following commands to start the required Docker containers:

```
mkdir -p alice bob carol
sudo docker run -d -it --name alice -v /root/alice:/root -p 6180:6180 -p 3000:3000 ubuntu:20.04 /bin/bash
sudo docker run -d -it --name bob -v /root/bob:/root ubuntu:20.04 /bin/bash
sudo docker run -d -it --name carol -v /root/carol:/root ubuntu:20.04 /bin/bash
```
Create testnet_iplist.txt for genesis members
Enter each container using the `docker attach <docker_name>` command and check the internal IP with `hostname -I`.
Then, create a `testnet_iplist.txt` file in the home directory (`~/`) of each container as shown below.
```
alice	172.17.0.2
bob	172.17.0.3
carol	172.17.0.4
```

## Step 3: Download and Execute the Genesis Setup Script(in Docker container)

Execute the following commands inside each container to download and run the genesis setup script:

```
apt update && apt install nano && apt install wget
wget -O ~/0l_testnet_genesis_docker.sh https://github.com/AlanYoon71/0L_Network/raw/main/0l_testnet_genesis_docker.sh \
&& chmod +x ~/0l_testnet_genesis_docker.sh && ./0l_testnet_genesis_docker.sh
```
After running the script and reaching the completion stage, if you're in the Docker container `alice`,
you should enter the current server's IP address when prompted for the VFN IP.
The VFN will be installed at the host level outside the container and connected to container `alice`.
If prompted from other Docker containers, simply press Enter.

## Step 4: Running the Libra Validator(in Docker container)

1. Install `tmux` inside each container if not installed:

    ```
    apt update && apt install tmux -y
    ```

2. Start a `tmux` session inside each container:

    ```
    tmux new -s node
    ```

3. Within the `tmux` session, run the `libra node` command:

    ```
    libra node
    ```
	
## Step 5: Check Syncing and Voting status

```
echo ""; curl -s localhost:9101/metrics | grep diem_state_sync_version{; \
echo -e "\nVote Progress:"; cat ~/.libra/data/secure-data.json | jq .safety_data.value.last_voted_round
```
If the sync and vote counts keep increasing, the blockchain is running successfully.
To exit the container(change to background), press Ctrl+p followed by Ctrl+q.
Don't type exit, then session process will be stopped.

## Step 6: Running the Libra VFN and Validators(outside the container and local network)

If you are installing VFN or Validator on another machine, there is no need to install Docker at all.
However, you can still install VFN on a machine with 3 containers installed.
To do so, execute the following commands outside each container to download and run the post-genesis node setup script:

1. Firewall setting for VFN:

    ```
    sudo ufw allow 6180; sudo ufw allow 6182; sudo ufw allow 8080; sudo ufw allow 3000; 
    ```
	
2. Firewall setting for post-genesis Validator:

    ```
    sudo ufw allow 6180; sudo ufw allow 6181; sudo ufw allow 3000; 
    ```

3. download and run the post-genesis node setup script:

    ```
    apt update && apt install nano && apt install wget
	wget -O ~/0l_testnet_setup.sh https://github.com/AlanYoon71/0L_Network/raw/main/0l_testnet_setup.sh \
	&& chmod +x ~/0l_testnet_setup.sh && ./0l_testnet_setup.sh
	```
	At the final stage of the script, if you're in the VFN for `alice`, enter the mnemonic for `alice`, 
	the Docker account where the VFN is connected.
	https://github.com/0LNetworkCommunity/libra-framework/raw/921d38b750b6a9529df9f0c7f88f5227bfc6a0de/util/fixtures/mnemonic/alice.mnem
	If you're in the genesis-post validator, enter the mnemonic for your own account. That's all.
	
	Carpe Diem, Carpe Libra!âœŠðŸ”†
